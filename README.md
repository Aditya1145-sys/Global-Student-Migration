# Global-Student-Migration

The primary objective of this notebook is to explores global student migration using the "Global Student Migration and Higher Education Trends" dataset. It examines where international students come from, where they go, what they study, and why they choose certain universities. Through data analysis and visualizations, we uncover key trends, top destinations, popular fields of study, and factors influencing student choices, such as scholarships and university reputation.

# Key Findings

Top Hubs for International Students: The United Arab Emirates (UAE), United Kingdom (UK), and Germany are the leading destination countries, attracting the highest number of international students.

Primary Origin Countries: Students migrating for education most frequently come from Russia, Germany, and Canada, making them the largest sources of international students.

Most Popular Academic Fields: The most in-demand fields of study are Social Sciences, Business, and Engineering, indicating a global focus on these disciplines for higher education.

Stable Enrollment Trends:**** International student enrollment has remained relatively consistent between 2019 and 2023, with a slight dip in 2021 followed by a swift recovery, suggesting a resilient demand for studying abroad.

Even Split in Scholarship Distribution: The data reveals a nearly 50/50 split between students who receive scholarships and those who do not, highlighting that a significant portion of students fund their education without financial aid.

Job Placement Rates: Post-graduation job placement is also evenly divided, with about half of the students securing a position after completing their studies.

Course Popularity Varies by Institution and Country: The analysis shows that the most popular courses differ significantly depending on the university and destination country, indicating that students often choose institutions renowned for specific programs.



# Conclusion

This analysis of the Global Student Migration dataset reveals key trends in international education. Top student destinations include the UAE, UK, and Germany, while Russia and Germany are major origin countries. Social Sciences, Business, and Engineering consistently emerge as the most popular fields of study. Our findings show stable enrollment over the last five years and an even split in scholarship distribution, painting a vivid picture of the global academic landscape. These insights are valuable for students, universities, and policymakers, and future work could involve predictive modeling to forecast migration trends.
